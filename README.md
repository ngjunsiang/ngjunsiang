## Hello!

Hi, I’m JS! In my job, I teach Computing at high school level in a junior college in Singapore. All the time, I’m exploring how we learn and know what we know, and how we teach it to others.

[My GitHub Page](https://ngjunsiang.github.io/about/) shows things I'm working on. Drop me an email if you are interested to collaborate!
